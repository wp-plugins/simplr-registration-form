== Description ==

This plugin allows users to easily add a custom user registration form anywhere on their site using simple shortcode.

To insert a registration form into a post or page just put the [Register] shortcode in the place where you want the registration form to show. By default users will be registered as subscribers. You can override the default by using the shortcode: [Register role="ROLE"].

Admin Email: Specify the FROM email you would like to use for the registration confirmation message.
Confirmation Message: Customize the message you would like to appear in the confimation email.
Style: Overrides the default stylesheet included with the plugin.
